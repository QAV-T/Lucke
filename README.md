### John Locke Quote on Memories
"Memory is the foundation of personal identity."

And,

"Memory is the storehouse in which the knowledge of a former state and condition of our being is laid up, which, though sometimes it is out of sight, is nevertheless always present and ready to be produced whenever it is called for."
